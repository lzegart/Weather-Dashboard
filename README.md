# Weather-Dashboard

This webpage deploys a weather dashboard in which the user can enter a city name in the search bar and will see the current date and time, and the weather for tha city. The page will display the temperature, wind speed, humidity, uv-index, and a 5 day forcast. 

Once the user clicks the search button the cities will be saved to local storage and display under the search bar.

To obtain the weather, the Open Weather APIs for current data and 5-day forcast were used with the fetch method.

In order to display current date and time, moment().format method was used from momentjs.com and H was used to obtain 24h time. 

This project uses bootstap and css to style elements.
